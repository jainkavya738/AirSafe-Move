#AirSafe-Move

###An Intelligent Air-Quality–Aware Mobility Prototype

AirSafe-Move is a hackathon prototype built by Team Vayu, focused on enabling safer and smarter movement decisions by leveraging modern web technologies and a clean, scalable frontend architecture.
This project was developed under hackathon constraints, emphasizing rapid prototyping, clarity of design, and real-world applicability.

Urban mobility is increasingly affected by environmental factors such as air quality, yet most navigation or planning tools ignore these risks.

AirSafe-Move addresses this gap by serving as a foundation for:
Environment-aware movement planning
Risk-conscious route and location decisions
Scalable integration of air quality intelligence

**Solution Overview**
AirSafe-Move is a modern web application prototype designed to demonstrate how air-quality intelligence can be integrated into user decision-making workflows.

The prototype focuses on:
1) Clean UI/UX for quick understanding
2) Fast interactions for real-time scenarios

🚀 Features (Prototype Scope):
1) Fast, responsive frontend built for real-time usage
2) Clean and accessible UI components
3) Modular codebase for easy feature expansion
4) Hot-reload development workflow for rapid iteration
